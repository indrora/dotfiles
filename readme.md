My dotfiles
===========

Everyone's putting things into their dotfiles. It's sickening! It's *scary* even. However, there
is a good reason to do it -- There's plenty of cool configurations out there.

My dotfiles are here. Here in 'master' you will find just this and some of my shared files. I have
several machines and they all have different dotfiles -- different needs for different environments.
